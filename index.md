title: Hacker Tools
---

Learn to make the most of the tools that
[hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) have been using for
decades.

As hackers, we spend a lot of time on our computers, so it makes sense to make
that experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. In this class, we’ll
help you learn how to make the most of tools that productive programmers use.

We’ll show you how to navigate the command line, use a powerful text editor,
use version control efficiently, automate mundane tasks, manage packages and
software, configure your desktop environment, and more.

**See [here](/lectures/) for links to all lecture videos and lecture notes.**

**Lectures**: Hacker Tools has concluded for IAP 2019.

**Staff**: This class is co-taught by [Anish Athalye](https://www.anishathalye.com/), [Jon
Gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com/), and [Jose Javier Gonzalez
Ortiz](http://josejg.com/).
