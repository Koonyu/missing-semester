代码不能完全按照您的想法运行，它只能完全按照您的写法运行，这是编程界的一条金科玉律。

让您的写法符合您的想法是非常困难的。在这节课中，我们会传授给您一些非常有用技术，帮您处理代码中的 bug 和程序性能问题。


# 调试代码

## 打印调试法与日志

"最有效的 debug 工具就是细致的分析配合位于恰当位置的打印语句" — Brian Kernighan, _Unix 新手入门_。

调试代码的第一种方法往往是在您发现问题的地方添加一些打印语句，然后不断重复此过程直到您获取了足够的信息并可以找到问题的根本原因。

另外一个方法是使用日志，而不是临时添加打印语句。日志较普通的打印语句有如下的一些优势：

- 您可以将日志写入文件、socket 或者甚至是发送到远端服务器而不仅仅是标准输出；
- 日志可以支持严重等级（例如 INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR等)，这使您可以根据需要过滤日志；
- 对于新发现的问题，很可能您的日志中已经包含了可以帮助您定位问题的足够的信息。


[这里](/static/files/logger.py) 是一个包含日志的例程序：

```bash
$ python logger.py
# Raw output as with just prints
$ python logger.py log
# Log formatted output
$ python logger.py log ERROR
# Print only ERROR levels and above
$ python logger.py color
# Color formatted output
```

有很多技巧可以使日志的可读性变得更好，我最喜欢的一个是技巧是对其进行着色。到目前为止，您应该已经知道，以彩色文本显示终端信息时可读性更好。但是应该如何设置呢？

`ls` 和 `grep` 这样的程序会使用 [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)，它是一系列的特殊字符，可以使您的 shell 改变输出结果的颜色。例如，执行 `echo -e "\e[38;2;255;0;0mThis is red\e[0m"` 会打印红色的字符串：`This is red` 。下面这个脚本向您展示了如何在终端中打印多种颜色。

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
for R in $(seq 0 20 255); do
    for G in $(seq 0 20 255); do
        for B in $(seq 0 20 255); do
            printf "\e[38;2;${R};${G};${B}m█\e[0m";
        done
    done
done
```

## 第三方日志系统

如果您正在构建大型软件系统，您很可能会使用到一些依赖，有些依赖会作为程序单独运行。如 Web 服务器、数据库或消息代理都是此类常见的第三方依赖。

和这些系统交互的时候，阅读它们的日志是非常必要的，因为仅靠客户端侧的错误信息可能并不足以定位问题。

幸运的是，大多数的程序都会将日志保存在您的系统中的某个地方。对于 UNIX 系统来说，程序的日志通常存放在 `/var/log`。
例如， [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) web 服务器就将其日志存放于`/var/log/nginx`。
最近，系统开始使用 **system log**，您所有的日志都会保存在这里。大多数的（但不是全部）Linux 系统都会使用 `systemd`，这是一个系统守护进程，它会控制您系统中的很多东西，例如哪些服务应该启动并运行。`systemd` 会将日志以某种特殊格式存放于`/var/log/journal`，您可以使用 [`journalctl`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html) 命令显示这些消息。
类似地，在 macOS there is still `/var/log/system.log` but an increasing number of tools use the system log, that can be displayed with [`log show`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/log/).

对于大多数的 UNIX 系统，您也可以使用[`dmesg`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html) 命令来读取内核的日志。

如果您希望将日志加入到系统日志中，您可以使用 [`logger`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html) 这个 shell 程序。下面这个例子显示了如何使用 `logger`并且如何找到能够将其存入系统日志的条目。

不仅如此，大多数的编程语言都支持向系统日志中写日志。

```bash
logger "Hello Logs"
# On macOS
log show --last 1m | grep Hello
# On Linux
journalctl --since "1m ago" | grep Hello
```

正如我们在数据整理那节课上看到的那样，日志的内容可以非常的多，我们需要对其进行处理和过滤才能得到我们想要的信息。

如果您发现您需要对 `journalctl` 和 `log show` 的结果进行大量的过滤，那么此时可以考虑使用它们自带的选项对其结果先过滤一遍再输出。还有一些像 [`lnav`](http://lnav.org/) 这样的工具，它为日志文件提供了更好的展现和浏览方式。

## 调试器

当通过打印已经不能满足您的调试需求时，您应该使用调试器。

调试器是一种可以允许我们和正在执行的程序进行交互的程序，它可以做到：

- 当到达某一行时将程序暂停；
- 一次一条指令地逐步执行程序；
- 程序崩溃后查看变量的值；
- 满足特定条件是暂停程序；
- 其他高级功能。

很多编程语言都有自己的调试器。Python 的调试器是[`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).

下面对`pdb` 支持对命令进行简单对介绍：

- **l**(ist) - 显示当前行附近的11行或继续执行之前的显示；
- **s**(tep) - 执行当前行，并在第一个可能的地方停止
- **n**(ext) - 继续执行直到当前函数的下一条语句或者 return 语句；
- **b**(reak) - 设置断点（基于传入对参数）；
- **p**(rint) - 在当前上下文对表达式求值并打印结果。还有一个命令是**pp** ，它使用 [`pprint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) 打印；
- **r**(eturn) - 继续执行知道当前函数返回；
- **q**(uit) - 退出调试器。

让我们使用`pdb` 来修复下面的 Python 代码（参考讲座视频）

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j] = arr[j+1]
                arr[j+1] = arr[j]
    return arr

print(bubble_sort([4, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6]))
```


注意，因为 Python 是一种解释型语言，所以我们可以通过 `pdb` shell 执行命令。
[`ipdb`](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) 是一种增强型的 `pdb` ，它使用[`IPython`](https://ipython.org) 作为 REPL并开启了 tab 补全、语法高亮、更好的回溯和更好的内省，同时还保留了`pdb` 模块相同的接口。

For more low level programming you will probably want to look into [`gdb`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (and its quality of life modification [`pwndbg`](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg)) and [`lldb`](https://lldb.llvm.org/).
They are optimized for C-like language debugging but will let you probe pretty much any process and get its current machine state: registers, stack, program counter, &c.


## Specialized Tools

Even if what you are trying to debug is a black box binary there are tools that can help you with that.
Whenever programs need to perform actions that only the kernel can, they use [System Calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call).
There are commands that let you trace the syscalls your program makes. In Linux there's [`strace`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html) and macOS and BSD have [`dtrace`](http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/). `dtrace` can be tricky to use because it uses its own `D` language, but there is a wrapper called [`dtruss`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/dtruss/) that provides an interface more similar to `strace` (more details [here](https://8thlight.com/blog/colin-jones/2015/11/06/dtrace-even-better-than-strace-for-osx.html)).

Below are some examples of using `strace` or `dtruss` to show [`stat`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html) syscall traces for an execution of `ls`. For a deeper dive into `strace`, [this](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/strace-the-sysadmins-microscope-v2) is a good read.

```bash
# On Linux
sudo strace -e lstat ls -l > /dev/null
4
# On macOS
sudo dtruss -t lstat64_extended ls -l > /dev/null
```

Under some circumstances, you may need to look at the network packets to figure out the issue in your program.
Tools like [`tcpdump`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tcpdump.1.html) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) are network packet analyzers that let you read the contents of network packets and filter them based on different criteria.

For web development, the Chrome/Firefox developer tools are quite handy. They feature a large number of tools, including:
- Source code - Inspect the HTML/CSS/JS source code of any website.
- Live HTML, CSS, JS modification - Change the website content, styles and behavior to test (you can see for yourself that website screenshots are not valid proofs).
- Javascript shell - Execute commands in the JS REPL.
- Network - Analyze the requests timeline.
- Storage - Look into the Cookies and local application storage.

## Static Analysis

For some issues you do not need to run any code.
For example, just by carefully looking at a piece of code you could realize that your loop variable is shadowing an already existing variable or function name; or that a program reads a variable before defining it.
Here is where [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tools come into play.
Static analysis programs take source code as input and analyze it using coding rules to reason about its correctness.

In the following Python snippet there are several mistakes.
First, our loop variable `foo` shadows the previous definition of the function `foo`. We also wrote `baz` instead of `bar` in the last line, so the program will crash after completing the `sleep` call (which will take one minute).

```python
import time

def foo():
    return 42

for foo in range(5):
    print(foo)
bar = 1
bar *= 0.2
time.sleep(60)
print(baz)
```

Static analysis tools can identify this kind of issues. When we run [`pyflakes`](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes) on the code we get the errors related to both bugs. [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) is another tool that can detect type checking issues. Here, `mypy` will warn us that `bar` is initially an `int` and is then casted to a `float`.
Again, note that all these issues were detected without having to run the code.

In the shell tools lecture we covered [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/), which is a similar tool for shell scripts.

```bash
$ pyflakes foobar.py
foobar.py:6: redefinition of unused 'foo' from line 3
foobar.py:11: undefined name 'baz'

$ mypy foobar.py
foobar.py:6: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "int", variable has type "Callable[[], Any]")
foobar.py:9: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "float", variable has type "int")
foobar.py:11: error: Name 'baz' is not defined
Found 3 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

Most editors and IDEs support displaying the output of these tools within the editor itself, highlighting the locations of warnings and errors.
This is often called **code linting** and it can also be used to display other types of issues such as stylistic violations or insecure constructs.

In vim, the plugins [`ale`](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/ale) or [`syntastic`](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/syntastic) will let you do that.
For Python, [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org) and [`pep8`](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) are examples of stylistic linters and [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) is a tool designed to find common security issues.
For other languages people have compiled comprehensive lists of useful static analysis tools, such as [Awesome Static Analysis](https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis) (you may want to take a look at the _Writing_ section) and for linters there is [Awesome Linters](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters).

A complementary tool to stylistic linting are code formatters such as [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python, `gofmt` for Go, `rustfmt` for Rust or [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) for JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
These tools autoformat your code so that it's consistent with common stylistic patterns for the given programming language.
Although you might be unwilling to give stylistic control about your code, standardizing code format will help other people read your code and will make you better at reading other people's (stylistically standardized) code.

# Profiling

Even if your code functionally behaves as you would expect, that might not be good enough if it takes all your CPU or memory in the process.
Algorithms classes often teach big _O_ notation but not how to find hot spots in your programs.
Since [premature optimization is the root of all evil](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization), you should learn about profilers and monitoring tools. They will help you understand which parts of your program are taking most of the time and/or resources so you can focus on optimizing those parts.

## Timing

Similarly to the debugging case, in many scenarios it can be enough to just print the time it took your code between two points.
Here is an example in Python using the [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) module.

```python
import time, random
n = random.randint(1, 10) * 100

# Get current time
start = time.time()

# Do some work
print("Sleeping for {} ms".format(n))
time.sleep(n/1000)

# Compute time between start and now
print(time.time() - start)

# Output
# Sleeping for 500 ms
# 0.5713930130004883
```

However, wall clock time can be misleading since your computer might be running other processes at the same time or waiting for events to happen. It is common for tools to make a distinction between _Real_, _User_ and _Sys_ time. In general, _User_ + _Sys_ tells you how much time your process actually spent in the CPU (more detailed explanation [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/556405/what-do-real-user-and-sys-mean-in-the-output-of-time1)).

- _Real_ - Wall clock elapsed time from start to finish of the program, including the time taken by other processes and time taken while blocked (e.g. waiting for I/O or network)
- _User_ - Amount of time spent in the CPU running user code
- _Sys_ - Amount of time spent in the CPU running kernel code

For example, try running a command that performs an HTTP request and prefixing it with [`time`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html). Under a slow connection you might get an output like the one below. Here it took over 2 seconds for the request to complete but the process only took 15ms of CPU user time and 12ms of kernel CPU time.

```bash
$ time curl https://missing.csail.mit.edu &> /dev/null`
real    0m2.561s
user    0m0.015s
sys     0m0.012s
```

## Profilers

### CPU

Most of the time when people refer to _profilers_ they actually mean _CPU profilers_,  which are the most common.
There are two main types of CPU profilers: _tracing_ and _sampling_ profilers.
Tracing profilers keep a record of every function call your program makes whereas sampling profilers probe your program periodically (commonly every millisecond) and record the program's stack.
They use these records to present aggregate statistics of what your program spent the most time doing.
[Here](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/17/how-do-ruby---python-profilers-work-) is a good intro article if you want more detail on this topic.

Most programming languages have some sort of command line profiler that you can use to analyze your code.
They often integrate with full fledged IDEs but for this lecture we are going to focus on the command line tools themselves.

In Python we can use the `cProfile` module to profile time per function call. Here is a simple example that implements a rudimentary grep in Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys, re

def grep(pattern, file):
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        print(file)
        for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):
            pattern = re.compile(pattern)
            match = pattern.search(line)
            if match is not None:
                print("{}: {}".format(i, line), end="")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    times = int(sys.argv[1])
    pattern = sys.argv[2]
    for i in range(times):
        for file in sys.argv[3:]:
            grep(pattern, file)
```

We can profile this code using the following command. Analyzing the output we can see that IO is taking most of the time and that compiling the regex takes a fair amount of time as well. Since the regex only needs to be compiled once, we can factor it out of the for.

```
$ python -m cProfile -s tottime grep.py 1000 '^(import|\s*def)[^,]*$' *.py

[omitted program output]

[omitted lines]
```


A caveat of Python's `cProfile` profiler (and many profilers for that matter) is that they display time per function call. That can become unintuitive really fast, specially if you are using third party libraries in your code since internal function calls are also accounted for.
A more intuitive way of displaying profiling information is to include the time taken per line of code, which is what _line profilers_ do.

For instance, the following piece of Python code performs a request to the class website and parses the response to get all URLs in the page:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# This is a decorator that tells line_profiler
# that we want to analyze this function
@profile
def get_urls():
    response = requests.get('https://missing.csail.mit.edu')
    s = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'lxml')
    urls = []
    for url in s.find_all('a'):
        urls.append(url['href'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_urls()
```

If we used Python's `cProfile` profiler we'd get over 2500 lines of output, and even with sorting it'd be hard to understand where the time is being spent. A quick run with [`line_profiler`](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) shows the time taken per line:

```bash
$ kernprof -l -v a.py
Wrote profile results to urls.py.lprof
Timer unit: 1e-06 s

Total time: 0.636188 s
File: a.py
Function: get_urls at line 5

Line #  Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
==============================================================
 5                                           @profile
 6                                           def get_urls():
 7         1     613909.0 613909.0     96.5      response = requests.get('https://missing.csail.mit.edu')
 8         1      21559.0  21559.0      3.4      s = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'lxml')
 9         1          2.0      2.0      0.0      urls = []
10        25        685.0     27.4      0.1      for url in s.find_all('a'):
11        24         33.0      1.4      0.0          urls.append(url['href'])
```

### Memory

In languages like C or C++ memory leaks can cause your program to never release memory that it doesn't need anymore.
To help in the process of memory debugging you can use tools like [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) that will help you identify memory leaks.

In garbage collected languages like Python it is still useful to use a memory profiler because as long as you have pointers to objects in memory they won't be garbage collected.
Here's an example program and its associated output when running it with [memory-profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) (note the decorator like in `line-profiler`).

```python
@profile
def my_func():
    a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
    b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
    del b
    return a

if __name__ == '__main__':
    my_func()
```

```bash
$ python -m memory_profiler example.py
Line #    Mem usage  Increment   Line Contents
==============================================
     3                           @profile
     4      5.97 MB    0.00 MB   def my_func():
     5     13.61 MB    7.64 MB       a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
     6    166.20 MB  152.59 MB       b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
     7     13.61 MB -152.59 MB       del b
     8     13.61 MB    0.00 MB       return a
```

### Event Profiling

As it was the case for `strace` for debugging, you might want to ignore the specifics of the code that you are running and treat it like a black box when profiling.
The [`perf`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html) command abstracts CPU differences away and does not report time or memory, but instead it reports system events related to your programs.
For example, `perf` can easily report poor cache locality, high amounts of page faults or livelocks. Here is an overview of the command:

- `perf list` - List the events that can be traced with perf
- `perf stat COMMAND ARG1 ARG2` - Gets counts of different events related a process or command
- `perf record COMMAND ARG1 ARG2` - Records the run of a command and saves the statistical data into a file called `perf.data`
- `perf report` - Formats and prints the data collected in `perf.data`


### Visualization

Profiler output for real world programs will contain large amounts of information because of the inherent complexity of software projects.
Humans are visual creatures and are quite terrible at reading large amounts of numbers and making sense of them.
Thus there are many tools for displaying profiler's output in an easier to parse way.

One common way to display CPU profiling information for sampling profilers is to use a [Flame Graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html), which will display a hierarchy of function calls across the Y axis and time taken proportional to the X axis. They are also interactive, letting you zoom into specific parts of the program and get their stack traces (try clicking in the image below).

[![FlameGraph](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpu-bash-flamegraph.svg)](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpu-bash-flamegraph.svg)

Call graphs or control flow graphs display the relationships between subroutines within a program by including functions as nodes and functions calls between them as directed edges. When coupled with profiling information such as the number of calls and time taken, call graphs can be quite useful for interpreting the flow of a program.
In Python you can use the [`pycallgraph`](http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/master/) library to generate them.

![Call Graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/A_Call_Graph_generated_by_pycallgraph.png)


## Resource Monitoring

Sometimes, the first step towards analyzing the performance of your program is to understand what its actual resource consumption is.
Programs often run slowly when they are resource constrained, e.g. without enough memory or on a slow network connection.
There are a myriad of command line tools for probing and displaying different system resources like CPU usage, memory usage, network, disk usage and so on.

- **General Monitoring** - Probably the most popular is [`htop`](https://hisham.hm/htop/index.php), which is an improved version of [`top`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html).
`htop` presents various statistics for the currently running processes on the system. `htop` has a myriad of options and keybinds, some useful ones  are: `<F6>` to sort processes, `t` to show tree hierarchy and `h` to toggle threads. 
See also [`glances`](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/) for similar implementation with a great UI. For getting aggregate measures across all processes, [`dstat`](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/dstat/) is another nifty tool that computes real-time resource metrics for lots of different subsystems like I/O, networking, CPU utilization, context switches, &c.
- **I/O operations** - [`iotop`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iotop.8.html) displays live I/O usage information and is handy to check if a process is doing heavy I/O disk operations
- **Disk Usage** - [`df`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/df.1.html) displays metrics per partitions and [`du`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.html) displays **d**isk **u**sage per file for the current directory. In these tools the `-h` flag tells the program to print with **h**uman readable format.
A more interactive version of `du` is [`ncdu`](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) which lets you navigate folders and delete files and folders as you navigate.
- **Memory Usage** - [`free`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html) displays the total amount of free and used memory in the system. Memory is also displayed in tools like `htop`.
- **Open Files** - [`lsof`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsof.8.html)  lists file information about files opened by processes. It can be quite useful for checking which process has opened a specific file.
- **Network Connections and Config** - [`ss`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ss.8.html) lets you monitor incoming and outgoing network packets statistics as well as interface statistics. A common use case of `ss` is figuring out what process is using a given port in a machine. For displaying routing, network devices and interfaces you can use [`ip`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip.8.html). Note that `netstat` and `ifconfig` have been deprecated in favor of the former tools respectively.
- **Network Usage** -  [`nethogs`](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs) and [`iftop`](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/iftop/) are good interactive CLI tools for monitoring network usage.

If you want to test these tools you can also artificially impose loads on the machine using the [`stress`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stress) command.


### Specialized tools

Sometimes, black box benchmarking is all you need to determine what software to use.
Tools like [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) let you quickly benchmark command line programs.
For instance, in the shell tools and scripting lecture we recommended `fd` over `find`. We can use `hyperfine` to compare them in tasks we run often.
E.g. in the example below `fd` was 20x faster than `find` in my machine.

```bash
$ hyperfine --warmup 3 'fd -e jpg' 'find . -iname "*.jpg"'
Benchmark #1: fd -e jpg
  Time (mean ± σ):      51.4 ms ±   2.9 ms    [User: 121.0 ms, System: 160.5 ms]
  Range (min … max):    44.2 ms …  60.1 ms    56 runs

Benchmark #2: find . -iname "*.jpg"
  Time (mean ± σ):      1.126 s ±  0.101 s    [User: 141.1 ms, System: 956.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    0.975 s …  1.287 s    10 runs

Summary
  'fd -e jpg' ran
   21.89 ± 2.33 times faster than 'find . -iname "*.jpg"'
```

As it was the case for debugging, browsers also come with a fantastic set of tools for profiling webpage loading, letting you figure out where time is being spent (loading, rendering, scripting, &c).
More info for [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler) and [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-toolss).

# Exercises

## Debugging
1. Use `journalctl` on Linux or `log show` on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day.
If there aren't any you can execute some harmless commands such as `sudo ls` and check again.

1. Do [this](https://github.com/spiside/pdb-tutorial) hands on `pdb` tutorial to familiarize yourself with the commands. For a more in depth tutorial read [this](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb).

1. Install [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   ## Example: a typical script with several problems
   for f in $(ls *.m3u)
   do
     grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f \
       && echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
   done
   ```

1. (Advanced) Read about [reversible debugging](https://undo.io/resources/reverse-debugging-whitepaper/) and get a simple example working using [`rr`](https://rr-project.org/) or [`RevPDB`](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/07/reverse-debugging-for-python.html).
## Profiling

1. [Here](/static/files/sorts.py) are some sorting algorithm implementations. Use [`cProfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) and [`line_profiler`](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) to compare the runtime of insertion sort and quicksort. What is the bottleneck of each algorithm? Use then `memory_profiler` to check the memory consumption, why is insertion sort better? Check now the inplace version of quicksort. Challenge: Use `perf` to look at the cycle counts and cache hits and misses of each algorithm.

1. Here's some (arguably convoluted) Python code for computing Fibonacci numbers using a function for each number.

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python
   def fib0(): return 0

   def fib1(): return 1

   s = """def fib{}(): return fib{}() + fib{}()"""

   if __name__ == '__main__':

       for n in range(2, 10):
           exec(s.format(n, n-1, n-2))
       # from functools import lru_cache
       # for n in range(10):
       #     exec("fib{} = lru_cache(1)(fib{})".format(n, n))
       print(eval("fib9()"))
   ```

   Put the code into a file and make it executable. Install [`pycallgraph`](http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/master/). Run the code as is with `pycallgraph graphviz -- ./fib.py` and check the `pycallgraph.png` file. How many times is `fib0` called?. We can do better than that by memoizing the functions. Uncomment the commented lines and regenerate the images. How many times are we calling each `fibN` function now?

1. A common issue is that a port you want to listen on is already taken by another process. Let's learn how to discover that process pid. First execute `python -m http.server 4444` to start a minimal web server listening on port `4444`. On a separate terminal run `lsof | grep LISTEN` to print all listening processes and ports. Find that process pid and terminate it by running `kill <PID>`.

1. Limiting processes resources can be another handy tool in your toolbox.
Try running `stress -c 3` and visualize the CPU consumption with `htop`. Now, execute `taskset --cpu-list 0,2 stress -c 3` and visualize it. Is `stress` taking three CPUs? Why not? Read [`man taskset`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/taskset.1.html).
Challenge: achieve the same using [`cgroups`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). Try limiting the memory consumption of `stress -m`.

1. (Advanced) The command `curl ipinfo.io` performs a HTTP request an fetches information about your public IP. Open [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and try to sniff the request and reply packets that `curl` sent and received. (Hint: Use the `http` filter to just watch HTTP packets).
